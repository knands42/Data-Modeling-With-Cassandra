# Data-Modeling-With-Cassandra

Resolution of the first project `Data Modeling (with Apache Cassandra)` from [Data Engineering with AWS](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/nd027) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

### Project Overview 

Create a NoSQL database in Apache Cassandra for a musica streaming app start-up called Sparkify. Model songs and user activity data to optimize queries for understanding app user behavior such as what songs users are listening to. 


* Build an ETL pipeline to transform a set of CSV files into a denormalized dataset
* Design and create Apache Cassandra data tables to answer specified business questions
* Insert data from the new dataaset to the Apache Cassandra tables
* Test by running `SELECT` statements to varify the data that have been inserted into each table
